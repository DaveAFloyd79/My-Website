<h1>This is a website.</h1>
<p>Specifically, this is my website. I'll be using this site to help me learn how to do stuff on the internet, mainly HTML, CSS, Git, accessability and inclusion for now.</p>

<p>I will also be using it to post weeknotes, if I can get back into writing them regulalry and other projects I'm working on.</p>

<p>The bggest flaw in my plan, as I see it, is me. And my annoyingly wavering interest in things, where I care about things deeplym until I don't.</p>

<p>Anyways heres to learning!</p>
