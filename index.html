<title>Dave Floyds Website</title>

<h1>This is a website!</h1>
<p>Specifically, this is my website. I'll be using this site to help me learn how to do stuff on the internet, mainly HTML, CSS, Git, accessability and inclusion for now.</p>
<p>For this experiment I will be using Visual Basic Code, <a href="https://github.com/DaveAFloyd79">GitHub</a> and Netlify to write, save and deploy, and a combination of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com">Flexboxfroggy</a> for leaning HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>I will also be using it to post weeknotes, if I can get back into writing them regulalry, and other random projects/ideas I'm working on or not as the case my be.</p>
<p>The biggest flaw in my plan, as I see it, is me, and my annoyingly flighty interest in things, where I care about things deeply, until I don't!</p>
<p>Anyways heres to learning!</p>
