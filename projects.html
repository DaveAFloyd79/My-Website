        <h2>About this page</h2>
        <p>I've worked on some side things that I've found interesting over the years. Some were just ideas that I never got aroudn to. Others are still just random thought sbubbling about in my brain that may never see the light of day. Or maybe they will.</p>
        <p>Anyways, heres some things below.</p>

                <p>Sometime around mid-2020, as we were all still coming to terms with lockdown and what it meant I stumbled across a Twitter post from <a href="https://twitter.com/McQuadeJess">Jess McQuade</a> of WWF Cymru. Having just read the fantastic Doughnut Economics from Kate Raworth and seeing Jess was looking to get a group of people onlien to havea  chat about eh principles behind it and what it could mean in Wales I decided to pop along.
